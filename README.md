# Landsat Reflectance Data: On the Fly and at Your Fingertips

## Project Overview

This project leverages Landsat Collection 2 data provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to deliver surface reflectance data efficiently. Landsat satellites (1-9) offer a wealth of data for environmental monitoring and land-use analysis.

## Features

- **Landsat Collection 2**: Provides Level-1 to Level-3 data, including surface reflectance and temperature products for Landsats 1-9.
  
- **Surface Reflectance Data**: Landsat 4-9 data includes high-quality global products with improved atmospheric correction, using auxiliary data.

- **Enhanced Geometric Accuracy**: Leveraging Sentinel-2 Global Reference Image for higher spatial accuracy in data.

- **Cloud-Optimized Format**: All Landsat Collection 2 data is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format for seamless cloud-based access.

- **Interoperability**: CEOS Analysis Ready Data (CARD4L) compliant, ensuring compatibility with other platforms like Sentinel-2.

## Data Access

we used landsat products that are available for download through the [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) and [LandsatLook](https://landsatlook.usgs.gov/) platforms.

## Technical Specifications

### Landsat Levels

1. **Level-1**: Radiometrically and geometrically corrected images.
2. **Level-2**: Surface reflectance and temperature.
3. **Level-3**: Scene-based science products, ready for time-series stacking and analysis.

### Data Formats

- **COG**: Cloud-optimized files allow users to download specific image bands rather than entire scenes.

### Quality Assurance

Each Landsat scene includes Quality Assessment (QA) bands to ensure data reliability and accuracy.
